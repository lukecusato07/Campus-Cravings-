### Overview

Campus Cravings is my final project for CS 0134 Web Site Design and Development. The goal of this project was to combine my skills in HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create a functioning product. Campus Cravings was designed with students like myself in mind. Often times, college life can be very busy, and the last thing you want to think about is having to prepare for yourself or travel to get food. This product is a convenient way for students to continue with their day and have ease of mind when planning out their meals. Students can select from a variety of cuisines, log promotion codes, engage with sale and trending items, view their past order history, update their payment and personal information, check the delivery status of their order, and even communicate with their delivery person.

### Empowering Student Employment

Further, Campus Cravings was also designed with the driver in mind. The site offers opportunities for students to take part in on-campus employment. While college life can be busy, it can also be expensive, and many students rely on part-time jobs for financial support. The site is designed so that students from the specific university can be the delivery person. Campus Cravings empowers students to be their own boss, allowing them to choose their own hours without even needing to leave campus for work.

### Site Development

Campus Cravings was designed with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The contents of the webpage were developed using HTML. Styling took place by using CSS, grouping HTML elements into Classes and IDs to streamline the styling process. The interactive aspects of the site, such as a carousel, price-quantity button system, and effective popup messages, were designed with JavaScript. The JavaScript can be found in the folder titled "javascript" or within the HTML, nested in the "<script>" tag.

I also designed a simple and scalable logo for Campus Cravings. This was done using Canva. You can find the logos that I designed in the folder titled "images."

### Future Development

Looking forward, there is still a lot of work to be done in order for Campus Cravings to be a fully functioning product. I'd like to share with you some possible future developments to make Campus Cravings even better. First, the site mainly only functions for the user ordering the food. I would develop the site so that administration from various universities could interact with Campus Cravings to make the site specific to their University. I would also need to make the site function for the driver. That would look like creating an interface that logged and kept track of deliveries, a GPS system, a message log, etc.

I would also want to develop the forms within this site. I could develop it so that when the user places their order, the information is sent to the driver. I would need to consider user privacy and effective methods of form submission. Part of developing the forms would also include sending the order information from the food options page to the order page. These developments were outside of the scope of my learning in CS 0134, but I am eager to learn the skills needed to create these additions to the site!

Lastly, I would develop the styling. I would do this using BootStrap. This would allow me to create a more cohesive and elevated design for my site. The CSS effectively styles the site as a preliminary product, but there are many aspects such as the history log which could use some design upgrades. This would be done using BootStrap!
